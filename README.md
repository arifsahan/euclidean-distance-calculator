Euclidean Distance Calculator
This code is developed as part of the IBM SkillsBuild and Kodluyoruz platform course. It serves as an example of lesson content.

This repository contains a Python program that calculates the Euclidean distance between points in a 2D space. The program defines a list of points, computes the Euclidean distance between each pair of points, and identifies the minimum distance among them.

Features
Point Definition: Define points in a 2D space using tuples.
Distance Calculation: Calculate the Euclidean distance between pairs of points.
Minimum Distance: Find and display the minimum distance among all point pairs.
